# JSON Generator Web App

This web application allows users to easily generate JSON objects with key-value pairs. It's a project created for the purpose of practicing JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and event handling. If you're new to web development or looking to improve your JavaScript skills, this project is a great place to start.

## Project Background

The motivation behind this project is to provide a hands-on opportunity to apply JavaScript knowledge, especially in the context of web development. Here are some key aspects of the project:

- **Dynamic Row Addition**: Users can click the "Add row" button to dynamically add new key-value pairs to the form. This demonstrates how to create and append elements to the DOM on user interaction.

- **JSON Generation**: The "Generate JSON" button processes the input data and generates a JSON object. The project showcases how to manipulate data and construct JSON structures programmatically.

- **Data Validation**: The application includes simple data validation. It checks the input value and interprets it as a string, number, boolean, or null, based on user input.

- **Clipboard Copy**: After generating JSON, users can click the "Copy" button to copy the JSON to their clipboard. This demonstrates how to interact with the clipboard using JavaScript.

- **Paste Functionality**: The project also includes a textarea where users can paste JSON data from their clipboard. This provides a two-way interaction with JSON data.
